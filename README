NAME
    Data::Transpose - Transpose, iterate, filter and validate data

    Caters to your needs for manipulating data by different operations,
    which are filtering records, iterating records, validating and
    transposing to different field names.

VERSION
    Version 0.0009

SYNOPSIS
        use Data::Transpose;

        my $tp = Data::Transpose->new;

REFERENCE
    Validator
        Data::Transpose::Validator

    Iterator
        Data::Transpose::Iterator

METHODS
  new
    Parameters for the constructor are:

    unknown
        Determines how to treat fields in the input hash which are not known
        to the Data::Transpose object:

        fail
            The transpose operation fails.

        pass
            Unknown fields in the input hash appear in the output hash. This
            is the default behaviour.

        skip
            Unknown fields in the input hash don't appear in the output
            hash.

        This doesn't apply to the transpose_object method.

  field
    Add a new field object and return it:

        $tp->field('email');

  group
    Add a new group object and return it:

        $tp->group('fullname', $tp->field('firstname'), $tp->field('lastname'));

  transpose
    Transposes input:

       $new_record = $tp->transpose($orig_record);

  transpose_object
    Transposes an object into a hash reference.
